## RxJs

What is it?

From glossary (from https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview)

### Observable

Represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events _(the thing that you subscribe to)_

### Observer 

A collection of callbacks (next, error, complete) that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable _(your functions that react to new events)_

### Operators 

Pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc. _(tools that you use to transform streams according to your needs)_
